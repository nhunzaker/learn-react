# Learning React

- Roles of props and state
- Lifecycle methods
- Creating React components

# Important!

- We should cover flexbox
- In order to develop and release apps for iOS, you will need to
  acquire an iOS developer’s account.
    - The account is free, and is sufficient for development.
    - You’ll eventually need a license to publish. Which is priced at
      $99/year.
- There is no repeatable background... yet
